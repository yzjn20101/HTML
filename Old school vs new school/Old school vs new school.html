              <h2>1.Technology in the Classroom</h2>
              <img src="students1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="AI generated image of students1">
              <p>Thirty years ago, students in New Zealand relied heavily on textbooks, handwritten notes, and physical libraries for their studies. Computers were rare in schools, and the internet was not widely available. Today, students have access to laptops, tablets, and online resources like Google Classroom and educational apps. Digital tools have transformed how students learn, making information more accessible and interactive.</p>

        <h2>2.Teaching Methods</h2>
        <img src="students2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="AI generated image of students2">
        <p>In the 1990s, teaching was often more traditional, with a focus on rote learning and teacher-led instruction. Today, New Zealand schools emphasize collaborative learning, critical thinking, and student-led projects. The curriculum has also evolved to include more diverse perspectives, such as Māori culture and history, reflecting New Zealand’s commitment to biculturalism.</p>

        <h2>3.School Environment</h2>
        <img src="students3.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="AI generated image of students3">
        <p> Schools in New Zealand have become more inclusive and diverse over the past 30 years. There is a greater focus on supporting students with different learning needs, and schools are more aware of mental health and well-being. Anti-bullying programs and peer support systems are now common, creating a safer and more supportive environment for students.</p>

            <img src="students4.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="AI generated image of students4">
            <p>Extracurricular activities have expanded significantly. While sports and music were popular 30 years ago, today’s students can choose from a wider range of options, including robotics, coding clubs, and environmental groups. These activities help students develop skills beyond the classroom and prepare for future careers.</p>

            <h2>5.Communication with Parents</h2>
            <img src="students5.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="AI generated image of students5">
            <p>In the past, parents relied on school newsletters and parent-teacher interviews to stay informed about their child’s progress. Today, schools use online platforms like Seesaw or Hero to share updates, grades, and feedback in real-time. This has made communication between schools and families more efficient and transparent.</p>
